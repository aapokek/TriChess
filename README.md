### 🛠️ Current Development Stage  

#### Current Status:  
- **Chessboard & Pieces**: The triangular chessboard tiles have been made and saved inside tileMap dictionary (Cube coordinates as keys, tiles as values).
  
#### To do:
- Create chess pieces and save them inside appropriate data structures with cube coordinates.
- Enable player interaction with pieces (drag and drop or click-to-move functionality).
- Implement movement rules based on the triangular board layout.
- Add turn-based mechanics, including player switching and move validation.
- Integrate win conditions (checkmate, stalemate, etc.).
